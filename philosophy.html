  <div class="blockquote">
      Do you want, my brother, to go into isolation? Do you want to seek the way to yourself? Then pause a while longer and listen to me.
      "He who seeks will himself easily become lost. All isolation is guild": thus speaks the herd. And you have long belonged to the herd.
      The voice of the herd will still resound in you too. And if you will say, "I no longer have one conscience with you," it will be a lament and an agony.
      Behold, this agony was itself born from the one conscience: and the final glimmer of this conscience still glows upon your misery.
      But you want to go the way of your misery, which is the way to yourself? Then show me your right and your strength for that!
      Are you a new strength and a new right? A first movement? A self-propelling wheel? Can you compel the very stars to revolve around you?
      Ah, there is so much lusting for the heights! There is so much convulsion of the ambitious! Show me that you are not one of the lustful and ambitious!
      Ah, there are so many great thoughts that do no more than a bellows: they just inflate and make emptier.
      Free, you call yourself? Your ruling thought would I hear then, and not that you have escaped from a yoke.
      Are you such as has the right to escape from a yoke? There are some who threw off their last shred of worth when they threw off their servitude.
      Free from what? What is that to Zarathustra! Brightly shall your eye announce to me: free for what?
      Can you give yourself your own evil and your own good, and hang your will over yourself as a law? Can you be your own judge and avenger of your law?
      Terrible it is to be alone with the judge and avenger of one's own law. Thus is a star thrown out into desolate space and into the icy breath of being alone.
      Today you still suffer from the many, you singular one: today you still have your courage whole and your hopes.
      But one day solitude will make you weary, one day your pride will buckle and your courage gnash its teeth. One day you will cry, "I am alone!"
      One day you will see what is lofty in you no longer and what is base all-too-closely; even what is sublime in you will frighten you like a spectre. One day you will cry: "Everything is false!"
      There are feelings that want to kill the solitary; if they do not succeed, well, then they themselves must die! But are you capable of being a murderer?
      Do you, my brother, already know the word "despising"? And the anguish of your righteousness in being righteous toward those who despise you?
      You compel many relearn about you: that they will hold against you. You came close to them and yet passed them by: that they will never forgive you.
      You pass over and beyond them: but the higher you climb, the smaller you appear to the eye of envy. But most hated of all is the one who can fly.
      "How could you want to be just toward me!" - you must say - "I myself choose your injustice as my allotted portion."
      Injustice and filth they throw at the solitary: but, my brother, if you want to be a star, you must shine no less brightly for them on that account!
      And beware of the good and the righteous! They like to crucify those who invent their own virtue for themselves - they hate the solitary.
      Beware also of the holy unity! For it, all that is not unitary is unholy; it also likes to play with fire - especially at the stake.
      And beware also of the attacks of your love! Too quickly does the solitary extend his hand to anyone he meets.
      To some people you may give not your hand, but only a slap with a paw: and I would that your paw might also have claws.
      But the worst enemy you can encounter will always be yourself; you lie in wait for yourself in caves and forests.
      You solitary, you are going the way to yourself! And your way leads past yourself, and past your Seven Devils!
      A heretic will you be to yourself, and a witch and soothsayer and fool, and doubter and unholy man and scoundrel.
      You must want to consume yourself in your own flame: how could you want to become new unless you have first become ashes!
      You solitary, you are going the way of the creator: a God you would create for yourself out of your Seven Devils!
      You solitary, you are going the way of the lover: yourself do you love, and therefore you despise yourself, as only lovers can despise.
      The lover wants to create, because he despises! What does he know of love who has not had to despise precisely what he loved!
      With your love go into your isolation, and with your creating, my brother: and only later will righteousness limp along after you.
      With my tears go into your isolation, my brother. I love him who wants to create beyond himself and thereby perishes.

  <div class="blockquote">
    What does one person give to another? He gives of himself, of the most precious he has, he gives of his life. This does not necessarily mean that he sacrifices his life for the other—but that he gives him of that which is alive in him; he gives him of his joy, of his interest, of his understanding, of his knowledge, of his humor, of his sadness—of all expressions and manifestations of that which is alive in him. In thus giving of his life, he enriches the other person, he enhances the other's sense of aliveness by enhancing his own sense of aliveness. He does not give in order to receive; giving is in itself exquisite joy. But in giving he cannot help bringing something to life in the other person, and this which is brought to life reflects back to him.

      Modern man has transformed himself into a commodity; he experiences his life energy as an investment with which he should make the highest profit, considering his position and the situation on the personality market. He is alienated from himself, from his fellow men and from nature. His main aim is profitable exchange of his skills, knowledge, and of himself, his "personality package" with others who are equally intent on a fair and profitable exchange. Life has no goal except the one to move, no principle except the one of fair exchange, no satisfaction except the one to consume.

      "What's this? Am I falling? My legs are giving way," thought he, and fell on his back. He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle of the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the red-haired gunner had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or saved. But he saw nothing. Above him there was now nothing but the sky- the lofty sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with gray clouds gliding slowly across it. "How quiet, peaceful, and solemn; not at all as I ran," thought Prince Andrew- "not as we ran, shouting and fighting, not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with frightened and angry faces struggled for the mop: how differently do those clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky! How was it I did not see that lofty sky before? And how happy I am to have found it at last! Yes! All is vanity, all falsehood, except that infinite sky. There is nothing, nothing, but that.

We owe nobody an explanation or an accounting, as long as our acts do not hurt or infringe on them.

      When we die there are two things we can leave behind us: genes and memes. We were built as gene machines, created to pass on our genes. But that aspect of us will be forgotten in three generations. Your child, even your grandchild, may bear a resemblance to you, perhaps in facial features, in a talent for music, in the colour of her hair. But as each generation passes, the contribution of your genes is halved. It does not take long to reach negligible proportions. Our genes may be immortal but the collection of genes that is any one of us is bound to crumble away. Elizabeth II is a direct descendant of William the Conqueror. Yet it is quite probable that she bears not a single one of the old king’s genes. We should not seek immortality in reproduction. But if you contribute to the world’s culture, if you have a good idea, compose a tune, invent a sparking plug, write a poem, it may live on, intact, long after your genes have dissolved in the common pool. Socrates may or may not have a gene or two alive in the world today, as G. C. Williams has remarked, but who cares?
