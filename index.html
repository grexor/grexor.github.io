      <i class="fas fa-keyboard"></i>&nbsp;<b>Computer Scientist</b> and <b>Bioinformatician</b>, mostly working on RNA analysis and crafting useful and beautiful (I hope!) web applications along the way.
      The web technology (Html5 + Javascript + Plotly, Python + mod_wsgi + R, Mysql) allows me to easily share and discuss results with fellow scientists.

      <p class="font-weight-light">
      I am developing and maintaining two web platforms, <a href='https://expressRNA.org' target=_new>expressRNA</a> and <a href='https://microbeatlas.org' target=_new>microbeAtlas</a>.

      <br>

      <p class="font-weight-light">
      <i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i>&nbsp;The platform <a href=https://expressRNA.org>expressRNA</a> integrates protein-RNA binding iCLIP with regulatory (exon and polyA site) information from high-throughput sequencing datasets (RNA-seq, 3'-end targeted RNA-seq). This allows us to study how protein-RNA binding regulates inclusion or exclusion of features (alternative splicing in case of exons and alternative polyadenylation in case of polyA sites).

      <br><br>

      <i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i>&nbsp;The platform <a href=https://microbeAtlas.org>microbeAtlas</a> is a powerful gateway to the analysis of more than 1M metagenome samples. The real power of the analyses is in presenting clusters named sample groups / habitats, which can be explored in an interactive fashion.

        Professionally, I was extremely lucky (and fingers crossed for the future!).
        My strong interest in computer science started in primary school with Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. I then spent countless hours programming and setting up the school Linux web server. I got hooked, computers and programming were wonderful, there were no mistakes, whatever you did the outcome was predictable, exactly as instructed. And you could always retry and retry, until you got it right.
        <br>Two other fields attracted me in high school: biology and philosophy.
        Somehow, computer science combined with biology via bioinformatics.
        And the best teacher of philosophy is life itself, don't you agree?
        <br>Anyways, I also met the right people at the right time and I owe a great deal to the mentorships and collaborations established over the years. I do my best to nourish these relationships <i class="far fa-smile"></i>
